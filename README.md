Here, we're going to create a simple React Hook‚öì to handle form as well as it's validation.

The advantage of this hook is,
‚è≠ It is Reusable, so that we can use it anywhere in our website or for other projects.
‚è≠ You can handle validation easily,we just have to put conditions for input fields where want to validate.
‚è≠ This hook makes error handling very easy, also we can customize error messages as well.
‚è≠ Very easy to implement and build
